# Deep Learning Basics

## 1 The Relationship Between Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning

### Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL) are two significant subfields of machine learning that often work in tandem in modern AI systems.

### Deep Learning

Deep learning focuses on neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. It excels at:

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Pattern detection

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is about training agents to make sequences of decisions to maximize cumulative rewards in an environment. It's particularly useful for:

- Problems involving sequential decision-making
- Long-term planning

### The Relationship

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: This combines both approaches. Deep neural networks are used as function approximators within RL algorithms to handle high-dimensional state spaces and complex decision-making processes.

- **Neural networks in RL**: DL models can be used to represent policies, value functions, or models of the environment in RL systems.

- **Feature extraction**: Deep learning can help extract relevant features from raw sensory data, which can then be used by RL algorithms for decision-making.

- **Handling complexity**: DL allows RL to scale to more complex problems with high-dimensional state and action spaces.

- **Transfer learning**: DL techniques can help RL agents transfer knowledge between related tasks.

### Conclusion

Deep learning provides powerful tools for representation learning and function approximation, while reinforcement learning offers frameworks for decision-making and optimization. Together, they enable the creation of more sophisticated AI systems capable of handling complex, real-world tasks.

## 2 Linear Regression

### Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.

### Basic Concept

In its simplest form, linear regression tries to fit a straight line to a set of data points. The equation of this line is typically represented as:

y = mx + b

Where:
- y is the dependent variable (what we're trying to predict)
- x is the independent variable
- m is the slope of the line
- b is the y-intercept

### Types of Linear Regression

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Involves one independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves two or more independent variables.

### Key Components

#### 1. Cost Function

The cost function measures how well the model fits the data. A common cost function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

MSE = (1/n) * Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)^2

#### 2. Optimization

The goal is to minimize the cost function. Common methods include:
- Ordinary Least Squares
- Gradient Descent

### Assumptions

Linear regression makes several key assumptions:
- Linearity
- Independence
- Homoscedasticity
- Normality

### Applications

Linear regression is used in various fields, including:
- Economics
- Finance
- Biology
- Social sciences

### Advantages and Limitations

#### Advantages:
- Simple and interpretable
- Computationally efficient

#### Limitations:
- Assumes a linear relationship
- Sensitive to outliers

### Conclusion

Linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding relationships between variables and making predictions. Its simplicity and interpretability make it a popular choice in many applications.

## 3 Gradient Descent

### Introduction to Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It's widely used in machine learning and deep learning for minimizing the cost function in various models.

### How Gradient Descent Works

- Start with initial parameter values
- Calculate the gradient (slope) of the cost function at the current point
- Move in the opposite direction of the gradient
- Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence

### Learning Rate

The learning rate determines the size of the steps taken in each iteration. It's a crucial hyperparameter:

- Too large: May overshoot the minimum
- Too small: Slow convergence

### Types of Gradient Descent

#### Batch Gradient Descent

- Uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient in each iteration
- Computationally expensive for large datasets

#### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

- Uses a single randomly selected data point to compute the gradient
- Faster but noisier updates

#### Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

- Uses a small random subset of data to compute the gradient
- Balances speed and stability

### Variants and Improvements

#### Momentum

Adds a fraction of the previous update to the current one, helping to overcome local minima

#### AdaGrad

Adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on historical gradients

#### RMSProp

Similar to AdaGrad, but uses a moving average of squared gradients

#### Adam

Combines ideas from momentum and RMSProp

### Challenges and Considerations

#### Local Minima

Gradient descent may get stuck in local minima, especially in non-convex optimization problems

#### Saddle Points

Points where the gradient is zero but are not local minima or maxima

#### Plateau Regions

Areas where the gradient is close to zero, slowing down convergence

### Applications

- Training neural networks
- Logistic regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Many other machine learning algorithms

### Conclusion

Gradient descent is a powerful and versatile optimization technique. Understanding its variants and potential pitfalls is crucial for effectively training machine learning models.

## 4 Logistic Regression

### Introduction

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm.

### Basic Concept

Logistic regression uses the logistic function (sigmoid function) to map any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1. The equation is:

P(Y=1) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

Where:
- P(Y=1) is the probability of the dependent variable being 1
- z is the linear combination of independent variables (β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ)
- e is the base of natural logarithms

#### Decision Boundary

The decision boundary is typically set at 0.5:
- If P(Y=1) > 0.5, predict class 1
- If P(Y=1) ≤ 0.5, predict class 0

### Types of Logistic Regression

#### Binary Logistic Regression
- Predicts a binary outcome (0 or 1)

#### Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Predicts a categorical dependent variable with more than two categories

#### Ordinal Logistic Regression
- Used when the dependent variable is ordinal

### Model Training

#### Cost Function
The cost function used is the log loss (cross-entropy):

J(θ) = -[y log(h(x)) + (1-y) log(1-h(x))]

#### Optimization
Typically uses gradient descent or its variants to minimize the cost function

### Assumptions

- Binary outcome variable
- Independence of observations
- Little or no multicollinearity among independent variables
- Linearity of independent variables and log odds

### Applications

- Medical diagnosis
- Credit scoring
- Marketing (predicting customer behavior)
- Spam detection

### Advantages and Limitations

#### Advantages:
- Easy to implement and interpret
- Efficient to train
- Less prone to overfitting in low-dimensional datasets

#### Limitations:
- Assumes a linear relationship between independent variables and log-odds
- May not perform well with complex relationships in data

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision and Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve and AUC

### Conclusion

Logistic regression is a powerful and widely used algorithm for binary classification problems. Its simplicity and interpretability make it a popular choice in many fields, especially when understanding the impact of features is as important as the prediction itself.


## 5 Fully Connected Network (FCN)

Also known as a dense network or multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a fully connected network is the simplest form of artificial neural network.
