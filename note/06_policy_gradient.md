# Policy Gradient and REINFORCE Algorithms

## 1. Policy Gradient Algorithm

Policy Gradient (PG) algorithms are a class of reinforcement learning methods that directly optimize the policy function. Unlike value-based methods, PG algorithms learn a parameterized policy that can select actions without consulting a value function.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Policy Function**: A function π(a|s) that maps states to actions, giving the probability of taking action a in state s.

2. **Objective Function**: Typically, the expected cumulative reward J(θ) = E[Σ r_t], where θ are the policy parameters.

3. **Gradient Ascent**: The core idea is to adjust the policy parameters in the direction of the gradient: θ <- θ + α∇J(θ)

### Advantages:

- Can learn stochastic policies
- Can handle continuous action spaces
- Often converge faster than value-based methods in some problems

### Challenges:

- High variance in gradient estimates
- Sensitive to hyperparameter choices

## 2. REINFORCE Algorithm

REINFORCE is a specific implementation of the policy gradient method, also known as Monte Carlo Policy Gradient.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize policy parameters θ
2. For each episode:
   a. Generate an episode following π(a|s)
   b. For each step t in the episode:
      - Calculate G_t (the return from step t)
      - Update θ: θ <- θ + α∇log π(a_t|s_t) G_t

### Key Features:

- Uses the entire episode return as the reward signal
- Updates occur only at the end of each episode
- Simple to implement but can have high variance

### Improvements:

- Adding a baseline (usually the value function) to reduce variance
- Actor-Critic methods that combine policy gradient with value function approximation

## 3. Policy Function Design

The design of the policy function is crucial for the performance of policy gradient methods.

### 3.1 Discrete Action Spaces

For discrete action spaces, the policy typically outputs a probability distribution over actions.

#### Common Approaches:

1. **Softmax Policy**: 
   π(a|s) = exp(θ_a^T φ(s)) / Σ exp(θ_i^T φ(s))
   
   Where φ(s) is the feature vector of state s, and θ_a are the parameters for action a.

2. **Gaussian Policy**: 
   For small discrete action spaces, you can use a Gaussian distribution and round to the nearest integer.

#### Implementation Considerations:

- Ensure the sum of probabilities equals 1
- Use temperature scaling to control exploration vs. exploitation

### 3.2 Continuous Action Spaces

For continuous action spaces, the policy typically defines a probability density function over the action space.

#### Common Approaches:

1. **Gaussian Policy**:
   a ~ N(μ(s), σ(s))
   
   Where μ(s) and σ(s) are neural networks that output the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.

2. **Beta Policy**:
   Useful for bounded action spaces, outputs parameters of a Beta distribution.

3. **Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG)**:
   Directly outputs the action, useful in deterministic environments.

#### Implementation Considerations:

- Ensure proper handling of action bounds
- Consider using tanh or sigmoid to bound network outputs
- Balance exploration and exploitation through the variance of the distribution

### General Design Principles:

1. **Expressiveness**: The policy should be able to represent complex decision boundaries.
2. **Differentiability**: Ensure the policy is differentiable for gradient-based optimization.
3. **Efficiency**: Consider computational costs, especially for real-time applications.
4. **Exploration**: Design policies that encourage sufficient exploration of the state-action space.
