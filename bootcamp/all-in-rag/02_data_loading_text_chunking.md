# Data Loading & Text Chunking

## Data Loading

### Key Concepts

- **Data source flexibility**: The project supports loading data from various sources such as plain text files, structured data, or others.  
- **Uniform interface**: Regardless of where the data comes from, it should be represented in a consistent internal format for later stages.  
- **Metadata inclusion**: Along with the content itself, relevant metadata (e.g. document IDs, source paths, etc.) is kept, to allow tracing back or associating context.  

### Steps / Components

1. **Reading raw data**  
   - Identify all files / documents to load.  
   - Read file contents (for example, reading `.txt` or `.md` files).  

2. **Creating a data representation**  
   - Structure the loaded data into a schema or object (e.g., with fields: `id`, `text`, `metadata`).  
   - Ensure every document or piece has a unique identifier.  

3. **Pre‑processing (optional / minimal at this stage)**  
   - Clean up whitespace, remove unwanted characters, unify encoding.  
   - Possibly handle special file types or nested structures.  

4. **Testing / verifying load**  
   - Make sure that the number of documents loaded matches expectations.  
   - Check that each document has the expected fields (text, metadata).  
   - Sample a few documents manually to ensure content correctness.

## Text Chunking

### Purpose

- **Enable manageable pieces**: Many downstream components (retrieval, embedding, etc.) have limits (e.g. maximum token count). Chunking divides large texts into smaller, manageable parts.  
- **Improve retrieval/matching**: Smaller chunks allow better matching by similarity, increasing chances that relevant pieces are retrieved.  
- **Preserve context**: While chunking, aim to keep coherent textual context (so that chunks aren’t arbitrarily cutting in the middle of semantically important boundaries).

### Techniques / Methods

- **Chunk size control by tokens or characters**: Define maximum size (in tokens or characters) per chunk.  
- **Overlap between chunks**: To avoid losing information at boundaries, allow chunks to overlap a little (i.e. include some shared text between adjacent chunks).  
- **Boundary alignment**: Wherever possible, align chunk boundaries with logical or semantic boundaries (paragraphs, sentences) to avoid splitting in awkward places.  

### Best Practices

- Choose chunk size considering the downstream model’s input limits.  
- Maintain some overlap (e.g. windows sliding) to reduce loss at boundaries.  
- Clean up chunks: remove empty or near‑empty chunks, ensure no redundant content.  
- Store chunk metadata (source document, chunk index, position) to trace back and to reconstruct if needed.
