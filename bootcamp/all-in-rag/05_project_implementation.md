## **RAG System for Recipe Q&A: Full Project Implementation Study Notes**

These notes summarize the key architectural decisions and implementation details for a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system focused on recipe question answering, based on the provided technical documentation.

### **1. Overall System Architecture & Goal**

The project, "Taste Test RAG System," aims to solve the "What to cook today?" dilemma using a highly-structured recipe dataset (from the HowToCook project).

The core goal is to build an intelligent Q\&A system that can:
* Answer specific recipe questions (e.g., "How to make Kung Pao Chicken?")
* Provide recipe recommendations (e.g., "Recommend a few simple vegetarian dishes")
* Retrieve ingredient information (e.g., "What ingredients are needed for braised pork?")

The overall RAG pipeline involves four main modules: **Data Preparation** $\rightarrow$ **Index Construction** $\rightarrow$ **Retrieval Optimization** $\rightarrow$ **Generation Integration**. The system also implements a **caching mechanism** for the vector index to speed up startup time.

### **2. Data Preparation Module (Section 2)**

The system leverages a **Parent-Child Chunking Strategy** for "small chunk retrieval, large chunk generation".

#### **2.1 Core Strategy: Parent-Child Chunking**

* **Parent Document**: The complete recipe Markdown file (e.g., `Kung Pao Chicken.md`).
* **Child Chunks**: Small, precisely-split sections based on Markdown headers (e.g., `## Ingredients`, `## Instructions`).
    * **Retrieval Phase**: Uses small child chunks for **precise matching** to improve retrieval accuracy (e.g., matching "what ingredients are needed?" to the "Ingredients" chunk).
    * **Generation Phase**: Passes the **complete parent document** to the Large Language Model (LLM) to ensure full context and a complete answer.
* **Structure**: The recipe documents are split using Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`).

#### **2.2 Key Implementation Details**

* **Document Loading**: Recursively loads all `.md` files, assigns a unique `parent_id` to each document, and marks it with `doc_type: "parent"`.
* **Metadata Enhancement**: Extracts key information from the file path and content to enrich the metadata.
    * **Category**: Inferred from the file path (e.g., 'meat\_dish', 'vegetable\_dish').
    * **Dish Name**: Extracted from the filename stem.
    * **Difficulty**: Analyzed and extracted from star ratings (e.g., `★★★★★` $\rightarrow$ 'Very Difficult') within the content.
* **Chunking**: Uses LangChain's `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`.
    * It splits on headers: `(#, "Main Title")`, `(##, "Level 2 Title")`, `(###, "Level 3 Title")`.
    * Each resulting chunk is assigned a unique `chunk_id`, maintains the `parent_id`, and is marked as `doc_type: "child"`.
* **Intelligent Deduplication**: When multiple child chunks of the *same* recipe are retrieved, the system uses the `get_parent_documents` method to retrieve the corresponding complete parent document only once. It **sorts** the retrieved recipes by the number of matched child chunks (relevance).

### **3. Index Construction & Retrieval Optimization (Section 3)**

#### **3.1 Index Construction**

* **Embedding Model**: **BGE-small-zh-v1.5** is used to convert the text chunks into vectors.
* **Vector Store**: **FAISS** is used for efficient storage and high-speed retrieval of vectors.
* **Caching Mechanism**: The index is built from chunks and saved locally (`index_save_path`) after the first run. Subsequent startups load the saved FAISS index in seconds, significantly reducing initialization time.

#### **3.2 Retrieval Optimization: Hybrid Search**

The system employs a **dual-retrieval** strategy: **Vector Retrieval** + **BM25 Retrieval**.

| Retrieval Type | Strength | Retriever |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vector Retrieval** | Semantic similarity, understanding user intent (e.g., "easy dishes") | `vectorstore.as_retriever` (FAISS) |
| **BM25 Retrieval** | Keyword matching, precise matching of dish names or ingredients (e.g., "Kung Pao Chicken", "potato") | `BM25Retriever.from_documents` |

* **Fusion Algorithm**: **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)** is used to merge and re-rank the results from both retrievers. RRF combines the rank information from the two lists, giving weight to documents that rank highly in either or both searches.
* **Metadata Filtering**: The system supports filtering by metadata like `category` (e.g., 'vegetarian') or `difficulty` (e.g., 'simple') during vector retrieval to narrow down the search space.

### **4. Generation Integration & System Integration (Section 4)**

The Generation Integration Module acts as the "brain," handling user intent and generating high-quality, relevant answers.

#### **4.1 Smart Query Routing**

The system uses the LLM to classify the user's query into one of three types, which dictates the subsequent processing and generation style:
1.  **'list'**: User wants a list of recipes or recommendations (e.g., "recommend three simple dishes").
2.  **'detail'**: User wants specific cooking methods or details (e.g., "How to make Kung Pao Chicken?").
3.  **'general'**: Other general Q\&A (e.g., "What is Sichuan cuisine?").

#### **4.2 Query Rewriting**

* **Purpose**: To convert vague or ambiguous user queries (e.g., "cooking") into queries better suited for retrieval (e.g., "simple and easy home-cooked recipes").
* **Logic**: The LLM analyzes the query; specific queries ('list', 'detail') are usually kept as-is, while 'general' or ambiguous queries are rewritten.

#### **4.3 Multi-Mode Generation**

Based on the query route, a tailored prompt and generation strategy is used:

| Mode | Query Type | Output Style | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **List Mode** | 'list' | Concise, numbered list of dish names | Extracts dish names from retrieved parent documents |
| **Detailed Mode** | 'detail' | Structured, step-by-step instructions | Uses a structured prompt for LLM output (Intro, Ingredients, Steps, Tips) |
| **Basic Mode** | 'general' | Standard Q\&A format | Provides a conventional answer to the general question |

#### **4.4 System Execution Flow**

1.  **Initialization**: Load all modules and check API keys.
2.  **Knowledge Base Build**: Attempt to load cached index; if none, build new index (Data Prep $\rightarrow$ Index Build $\rightarrow$ Save Index).
3.  **Ask Question**:
    * Query Routing $\rightarrow$ Query Rewriting (if needed).
    * Hybrid Search to get relevant **child chunks**.
    * Intelligent Deduplication to retrieve relevant **parent documents**.
    * Multi-Mode Generation using the correct strategy (List/Detail/Basic) $\rightarrow$ **Final Answer**.
4.  **Interactive Interface**: Provides a command-line interface with an option for **streaming output** using `chain.stream()` for a real-time, character-by-character effect.

### **5. Future Optimization Directions**

The documentation suggests several advanced directions for improvement:
* **Graph Database Integration**: Converting recipes to a graph structure to support complex relationship queries (e.g., "ingredients that pair well with chicken").
* **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Integrating images for combined text/image retrieval and supporting visual queries (e.g., "What dish is this?").
* **Specialized Knowledge Enhancement**: Adding knowledge bases for nutrition, cooking techniques, and ingredient substitution rules.
